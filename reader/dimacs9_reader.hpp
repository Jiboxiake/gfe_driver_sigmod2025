/**
 * Loader for the DIMACS challenge #9 file format, year 2005/06, spec: http://users.diag.uniroma1.it/challenge9/format.shtml#graph
 *
 * The file always represents a weighted graph. The format is ASCII and it is similar to plain edge list. The first character of
 * each line determines the type of information that follows on the same line:
 * c - the rest of the line is a comment and should be ignored
 * p - problem specification, ignored for this loader
 * a - an edge in the format src dst weight
 *
 * Example, a graph with three edges 1->2 (weight=10), 1->5 (weight=100), 2->3 (weight=20):
 * c This is a header comment
 * c and should be ignored
 * p sp n m
 * a 1 2 10
 * a 1 5 100
 * a 2 3 20
